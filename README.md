# Docker
I started this project because I wanted to learn Docker.  In addition to learning Docker I get to practice Nodejs / Express / Bootstrap / Open-Iconic / JQuery

## Road Map
Sept 2017 - get a simple prototype working by the end of the month.

## To Do

- login / authentication with 2FA support (far future) - https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-2fa
- websocket for docker stats - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-ws (far future)
- D3.js for nice data driven display eventually - https://d3js.org/ (far future)
- use ReactJS for forms? - https://facebook.github.io/react/ (far future)
- Unit Testing
- Make a version # for this project
- Always too much to do.

## Issues
NodeJS doesn't seem to have an actual way to detect logically core vs physical core.
Docker only used actual physical cores.. so on my laptop I have 4 physical cores but because of hyper threading it's 8


## Requirements

1. nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/
2. docker - https://www.docker.com/
3. pm2 - http://pm2.keymetrics.io/
