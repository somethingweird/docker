# Docker
I started this project because I wanted to learn Docker.  In addition to learning Docker I get to practice Nodejs / Express.

## Road Map
Sept 2017 - get a simple prototype working by the end of the month.  Make a version number

## To Do
Always too much.

## Requirements
1. nodejs
2. docker (of course)
